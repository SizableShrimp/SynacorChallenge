Here are the MD5 hashes of the eight codes produced by this instance of the
challenge for use in testing implementations of the architecture.  These codes
can be validated as follows, replacing the quoted string with the code to test:

```console
$ echo -n "<Code Here>" | md5sum
6fcd818224b42f563e10b91b4f2a5ae8  -
```
